Made this .txt in my local directory

Then did a:
     > git status
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	NPRs_test.txt
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


Then:
	> git add NPRs_test.txt 
	> git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   NPRs_test.txt
#
